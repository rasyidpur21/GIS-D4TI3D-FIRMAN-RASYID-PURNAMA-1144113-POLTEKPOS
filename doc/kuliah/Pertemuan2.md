SPATIAL DATA

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM
    Hello all my friends, all the best wishes. On the blog this time I will explain about the Spatial Data in Geographic Information Systems. This is my second blog in core material "Geographic Information System" that basically I am studying well. Surely there will be some things that will be delivered in Spatial Data of this material, and if the explanation is too crowded then you can see in my vlog that I have included in this blog.

BACKGROUND :

    Geographic Information System / GIS is an information system based on spatial data and objects representing the earth. SIG itself in information technology is a tool which helps in storing the data, process the data, analyze the data, managing data and presenting information.
        We need to know that the SIG has critical components in realizing it. One important component is the Spatial Data.

The story anyone ask
eneng: Spatial Data Huh? What does the Spatial Data kang ???

aa: Okay calm neng akang explain!

Spatial data is data related to the geometry of spatial and data attributes that provide data about the shape of spatial information.

aa: Gitu loh neng .. how to understand ndak?

eneng: Still less ih kang jelasin try again !!

aa: Owadalah okay we let's Go to the discussion !!

DISCUSSION:
  Spatial data is geographically referenced data on the representation of objects on earth. Spatial data is typically derived based on a map or maps containing interpretation and projection of the whole phenomenon that is on the earth. The phenomenon is a natural phenomenon manmade. There are three basic ways that can be done to present the spatial data, such as point-shaped, line-shaped and shaped area.
Point shape: a shape that resembles the appearance of a single pair of coordinates derived from the coordinate x and y, which indicates the location or object in the form of altitude, city location, location somewhere, and so on.
Shape Outline: a collection of dots into a single unit that extends semperti form of rivers, roads, kontus and so forth.
Area shape: a shape or appearance of which has a limit in the form of a line that will eventually form a space. Example: Limit islands, border areas, borders between countries and so on.
     Spatial Data has two types, namely the type of vector and Ruster. Vector data model displays, placing, and store spatial data using points, lines or curves, or polygons and their attributes. Raster models displaying, and storing spatial data using a matrix structure or pixels that make up the grid. These spatial models utilized according to their needs.
Okay let's discuss further back in the Vector and Raster Data Model:
Vector Data:
As described previously, the data model is a vector that can display, placing and storing spatial data using points, lines or polygons along kirva and attributes. The basic forms of spatial data representation is, in the system of vector data model, defined by the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system (x, y).
   In the model of spatial data vectors, lines or curves (arc or arcs) is an ordered set of dots to be connected. Polygon will be fully developed if the starting point and end point polygon has a value equal to the coordinates of the starting point. While the shape of the polygon is stored as a set of interrelated list dynamically using the pointer / point.
Raster Data:
  Objects on the Earth's surface is presented as an element of a matrix or grid of cells homogeneous. Raster data model display, placing and storing dataspasial by using a matrix structure or pixels that make up the grid. The level of accuracy of raster data model is highly dependent on the resolution or pixel size of the object on the earth's surface. Entity spatial raster stored in layers that functionality in relasikan with the elements - elements of the map.
  Unit raster data elements commonly called a pixel, these elements is extracting from an image stored as a digital number (DN). Reviewing the structure of raster data model is identical to the form of a matrix. In the data model raster, matrix or array is sorted by column coordinates (x) and the row (y).
Spatial processing:
    In the spatial processing to do the data analysis relies data model. Spatial Data processing can be done with a technique called geoprocessing. What's the hell wrote of Spatial Processing? Here are the Spatial processes:
Overlay: a blend of two spatial data layers.
Clip: an area by area of ​​intersection as a reference.
Intersection: the intersection of two areas that have the character and the same criteria.
Buffer: add a certain area around the object.
Query: is the data selection based on certain criteria.
Union: a combination of the two spatial data and attributnya into one.
Merge: merging two different data on the spatial feature.
Dissolve: combine several different values ​​based on specific attributes.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS :

   In the development of Geographic Information Systems Spatial Data required Spatial Data which has two important components, namely Model Vector and Raster and components can be used as a development of the manufacture of images to create an object in accordance with the needs and with what we wanted.
   My suggestion that the future implementation of spatial data can be realized significantly so that it can be studied and understood by many people.
