Background :
   Geographical Information Systems (GIS) or the Geographic Information System (GIS) is an information system designed to work with data referenced spatial or berkoordinat geography or in other words, a GIS is a database system with specific capabilities for handling data referenced spatial ( spatial) working in conjunction with a set of operations (Barus and Wiradisastra, 2000). Meanwhile, according to Anon (2001), Geographical Information System is an information system that can combine the graphics data (spatial) with text data (attribute) the object connected in geogrfis in earth systems (GIS). In addition, GIS can also consolidate data, manage data and perform data analysis that would eventually produce output that can be used as a reference in making decisions on issues relating to geography.

discussion:
   In Geographic Information Systems are the classes to be used. One of them is a shapefile. What the heck shapefile it? Shapefile is a tool that can perform the calculation of the amount of an object, such as the number of cities that are in the scope of particular use multiple systems. The system used in the calculation or see shapefile that I will explain using the python because it is more efficient and easy to use.
  On the use of the shp shapefile or there are several methods that are used, for example, is a method Reader and the Shape. The function of the method Reader among others, is to read the data contained in the shp file, for example, is shapefile.Reader ( "shp / firman.shp). From this example we can get the script in addition to the output of the results of the data contained in the file firman.shp. While functions on the Shapes method is to read the shapes or the data contained in the shp file. eg len (shapes). So basically of script code that we can get the output amount of the data shp itself.
     In looking at existing data on the shape files we use Python, Pyshp and PIP process that can be run via command prompt terminal owned by the windows.

conclusion:
To view the data or add up the amount of data available in shapefile it can be done fairly easily because it can be done via the command prompt contained in windows.
Suggestion :
It's good for learning can be used and effectively implemented of course by deepening our understanding of the science and GIS
