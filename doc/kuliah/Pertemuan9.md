Background :
At a meeting in a previous blog, I have discussed the MapServer and MapProxy and Geographic Information Systems. This time I will explain briefly about the use of a web service on geospatial data.
In processing geospatial data, required a service to bridge between the server and data processing. This progress is needed because the data will be accessed every day is a dynamic data and applications that require geospatial data definitely requires regular updates that will not be possible on the client side.

discussion:
Web service is the application of a set of data (databases), software (software) or a piece of software that can be accessed remotely by various devices with a particular intermediary. In general, the web service can be identified by using a URL such as only the web in general.
Geospatial Web Service (GWS) helps users find, access, and sometimes manipulate the data of interest in the dynamic web of distributed network. GWS is designed to collect data once and update or edit them in real time.
Many GIS users do not follow the development of tools and standards that facilitate the creation of dynamic GWS to access geospatial data and products. However, non-experts are already deploying GWS built to SUN (Fischer 2009). This article seeks to briefly explain select geospatial web services and to introduce the reader to demonstrations and selection tools that enable interoperability GWS. It describes the tools and resources that are useful for those who want to build their own geospatial services.
Implementation of GWS, both for geovisualizations, spatial analysis, cell phone, or options geogrid, which is enhanced by collaboration with a consortium of regional and global (eg, Consortium Geospatial Open (OGC), the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo), the Open Grid Forum (OGF)) , national institutions, and industry. OGC cooperate with a wide spectrum of users. Many tools are used to provide the functionality described as GWS is geoportals that spatial data services infrastructure (SDI) initiative, and the scientific community and the social sciences.
Geospatial less the same work with web services in general. However, there are specific things that need to be considered such as:
Web browsers used typically use: Open Layer, Leaflet Js or whatever.
Geoserver consists of: WMS, WMTS, WCF, WFS.- Data Store consists of: Shapefile and others.

Conclusion
Web service is the application of a set of data (database), or a piece of software that can be accessed remotely by various devices with a particular intermediary.
In general, the web service can be identified by using the URL as well as the web in general.
Web browsers used typically use: Open Layer, Leaflet Js or whatever.
Geoserver consists of: WMS, WMTS, WCF, WFS.
Data Store consists of: Shapefile and others.
